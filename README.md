# Rust Text Adventure

Text-based role-playing game written in the Rust Programming Language as a learning exercise. It's inspired by classic text adventures and role-playing games.
As with basically all my projects it's far from complete, but you're welcome to play around! 

The license currently undecided. You should probably hold off on forking and/or contributing until I've made my mind up.
